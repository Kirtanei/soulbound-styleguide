##### Generating
The Table of Contents can be generated via the Homebrewery functions; from *Text Editor*, select *Table of Contents*. This will auto-generate the table of contents based on your headings and  automatically indent them based on heading level (headings 1 through 3. No more, no less!). If you make changes to your content, you will need to re-insert a new table of contents, it will **not** automatically update along with your content.

##### Omitting Entries
To omit an entry from being automatically generated in the contents table via the *Table of Contents* function, add a whitespace character (such as a space) in front of the heading you wish to omit. It will still render normally on the page.

# Examples
The following guide is going to present a number of examples that you can draw from, either when starting out using Homebrewery, or if you're familiar with how Homebrewery work, and are getting familiarized with these Soulbound-tuned changes. Not everything works out of the box with the normal Homebrewery functions, since those are tuned for D&D content, that follow different content structures *(such as NPC stat blocks)*. 



## Headings
The following are examples of the Soulbound-styled headings.
:::::::::::::::::::::
 # H1 Heading
The h1 heading, used for chapters and spans both columns. The core book offers an alternate h1 header in white, and sometimes spans multiple lines — this is not yet replicated by this style layout. Only the above is available out of the box; centered and golden-colored. 

 ## H2 Header
The h2 heading, *generally* used to sub-divide the contents laid out by the chapter header. 


 ### H3 Heading
The h3 heading, often used as the archetype heading (see Archetype Example), or before a group of h4 items.

#### H4 Heading
The h4 heading is the basic element heading. Used for anything that portrays an element in the book; from equipment and talents, to spells and miracles.

##### H5 Heading
The h5 heading is generally when a h4 item can be further sub-divided or expanded upon; such as the species bonus sub-element, or a Talent granting specific abilities (see *Nav-League Member; Aethersight* from **Champions of Order**).

- **List Item:** Represents items in a list. Such as when offering options for a player to choose from.

## NPC Stat Blocks
The stat block grows with its content. It does not currently support spanning multiple columns (if brewing very large stat blocks).

::
{{note
##### NPC Stat Block
The structure of the NPC Stat blocks are important, and must adhere to the example below. The content can be what you like, but straying from the markdown structure is like to break its appearance.

## Archetypes

### Aethernaut Operator

{{note
##### Archetype Block
The Archetype blocks requires a faction and a number to designate an archetype box for it. Factions as of writing are *order (1-8)*, *death (1-4)*, *destruction (1-4)* and *seraph (1)*. The order of content is also important (Attributes, **then** the text). Use the example in this document to write up your own.

***Example:** An Archetype box for a Fyreslayer is designated as 'archetype,order-3'.*  

**Note** that archetype blocks have varying heights. Pick your intended archetype block and design around that.

##### White Backgrounds
When using an image with a non-transparent white background, add "transparent" to the list of properties to the image (noted in { } brackets).

## Tables
Tables are fairly simple constructs, and can be generated using Homebrewery; select *Tables* → *Table/Wide Table*. The auto-generated wide table uses standard annotation for a column-spanning table, but that won't be necessary with the **Soulbound** style sheet. The heading used for the table title dictates the size of the table.

- A h4 heading (\#\#\#\#) denotes a wide table.
- A h5 heading (\#\#\#\#\#) denotes a small table.
::
{{note
##### Wide Table Behavior
Content above a Wide table (and all other wide content, really) splits the columns above it as being a full page, rather than going down to the end, as seen here.
}}







#### A Wide Table
| Rating | Explanation | 
|:--:|:-------|
| Extraordinary  | You have an almost supernatural talent for the task.  |
| Superb  | Few in all the realms can match your skill or ability. You are exceptional.  |
| Great  | You excel at the task.  |
| Good  | You are well-trained and have a natural gift for the task.  |
| Average  | You have some training or natural affinity in that area.  |
| Poor  | You are inexperienced or particularly inept.  |

##### A Normal Table
| Rating | Explanation | 
|:--:|:-------|
| Extraordinary  | You have an almost supernatural talent for the task.  |
| Superb  | Few in all the realms can match your skill or ability. You are exceptional.  |
| Great  | You excel at the task.  |

| Poor  | You are inexperienced or particularly inept. |

## Frontpages
When working with the frontpage, add \{\{ frontCover \}\} to the page. It adds the **Soulbound** logo and modifies both the h1- and h2 headings when on the same page. 
- **h1.** The text is added below the **Soulbound** logo.
- **h2.** The text is added as the frontpage footer.

#### Adventure
The frontpage block can be expanded with the module tag, doing so adds the black panes to the top and bottom of the frontpage; \{\{ frontCover,module \}\}.
:
{{note
##### Limited Generation Support
It is possible to generate a frontpage using Homebrewery functions; *PHB* → *Front Page Cover*, but it is fundamentally designed with D&D in mind and you'll have a bit of manual cleanup to do because of that.
}}

## Chapter Banners
Chapter banners lets you add an additional level of both detail and organisation to your pages.

There's a total of 11 banners, noted as banner-1 through banner-11.
